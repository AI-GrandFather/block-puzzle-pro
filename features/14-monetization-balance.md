## Core Principles

### Fair Free-to-Play Guidelines

**Never Gate Core Gameplay:**
- All game modes accessible to free players
- Core mechanics never locked behind paywall
- Competitive in leaderboards without spending
- Can unlock all content through progression (just slower)

**Respect Player Time:**
- No artificial timers forcing payment
- No pay-to-progress requirements
- No energy/stamina systems
- No mandatory ads blocking gameplay

**Transparent Pricing:**
- Clear costs, no hidden fees
- No loot boxes or gambling
- No dark patterns or fake urgency
- Fair coin earn rate vs. spend rate

## Economy Balance

### Coin Economy

**Free Player Path:**
- Daily Login: 50-200 coins (streak-based)
- Level Completion: 50-150 coins per level
- Achievements: 100-1000 coins
- Daily Challenges: 100 coins
- Weekly Events: 150-1000 coins
- **Total Possible/Week:** ~1500-2000 coins (active player)

**Coin Sinks (Optional Spending):**
- Hint: 100 coins
- Continue Game: 200 coins
- Skip Level: 500 coins
- Theme Unlock: 1000 coins
- Power-Up Pack: 300 coins

**Balance Target:**
- Free players earn enough for 2-3 meaningful purchases per week
- Never feel forced to spend
- Premium feels valuable, not essential

### XP Balance

**Free vs Premium Progression:**
- Free: Reach Level 50 in ~3-4 months (daily play)
- Premium (2x XP): Reach Level 50 in ~1.5-2 months
- Premium offers convenience, not competitive advantage

## Conversion Strategy (Soft Sell)

### Value Proposition (Not Pressure)

**Good Practices:**
✅ Show benefits clearly
✅ Offer after positive moments (level complete, achievement)
✅ Provide value through temporary access (try before buy)
✅ Respect "No Thanks" with no penalties
✅ Limit offer frequency (max 1 per session)

**Avoid:**
❌ Interrupting gameplay with offers
❌ False scarcity ("Only 2 left!")
❌ Manipulative language
❌ Hiding "No" button
❌ Repeated popups after decline

### Conversion Funnel

1. **Awareness:** Free trial, temporary unlocks via ads
2. **Interest:** See benefits in action
3. **Consideration:** Compare free vs. premium clearly
4. **Purchase:** Simple, quick checkout
5. **Retention:** Deliver value, celebrate purchase

**Target Conversion Rates:**
- Any Paid: 5% (5% of players spend money)
- Premium Subscription: 2%
- Remove Ads: 3%
- Rewarded Ad → Purchase: 10%
