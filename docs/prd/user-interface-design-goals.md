# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Block Puzzle Pro delivers an immediately intuitive puzzle experience that feels both familiar and fresh. The interface prioritizes clarity and responsiveness over visual complexity, with colorful geometric blocks that pop against a clean background. Every interaction should feel satisfying through subtle haptic feedback and smooth animations that celebrate player achievements. The design philosophy centers on "invisible complexity" - sophisticated progression systems work behind the scenes while maintaining the visual simplicity that made classic block puzzles appealing.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop mechanics feel natural and precise, with visual feedback showing valid placement zones
- **Progressive Disclosure**: UI elements appear contextually (timer options unlock at 1000 points) rather than overwhelming new players
- **Celebration-Driven Feedback**: Line clears, score milestones, and new unlocks trigger satisfying visual and haptic responses
- **Player-Controlled Flow**: No interruptions or forced tutorials - players discover features organically through gameplay

## Core Screens and Views
- **Game Board Screen**: Primary 10x10 grid with persistent bottom block tray and score display
- **Tutorial Overlay**: Contextual guidance system that appears during first play without blocking interaction
- **Timer Selection Modal**: Clean interface for choosing 3/5/7 minute modes when unlocked
- **Game Over Screen**: Score summary with optional "Continue with Ad" and restart options
- **Block Unlock Celebration**: Brief animated notification when new shapes become available

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The game will implement WCAG AA compliance including high contrast color options for blocks, VoiceOver support for navigation elements, and haptic alternatives to audio feedback. Block shapes will be distinguishable through pattern/texture in addition to color to support colorblind players.

## Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with vibrant block colors (blues, greens, oranges, purples) against neutral backgrounds. Visual style emphasizes geometric precision and satisfying fits, drawing inspiration from successful puzzle games while maintaining unique personality. Typography will be clean and readable across all device sizes.

## Target Device and Platforms: Portrait-Only iOS
Portrait-only iOS design supporting iPhone SE through iPad Pro with fixed vertical orientation. Interface optimized for comfortable one-handed gameplay typical of mobile puzzle experiences.
