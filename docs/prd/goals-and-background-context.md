## Background Context

Block Puzzle Pro addresses a critical retention crisis in mobile puzzle games, where industry averages show devastating 1.5-3% Day 28 retention rates primarily due to repetitive mechanics that fail to evolve. Research reveals players abandon block puzzle games because difficulty increases only through speed rather than meaningful variety, creating predictable gameplay patterns that lose appeal after mastery.

Our solution implements a "Progressive Engagement Architecture" targeting casual mobile gamers (25-45 years old) who desire quick mental stimulation during breaks but need flexible session lengths. By introducing new block shapes at score-based milestones (every 500-2500 points) rather than artificial speed increases, the game maintains novelty while respecting casual accessibility. The technical foundation leverages Swift 6.1 + SpriteKit with iOS 18.6.2 optimization, supporting a rapid 6-8 week development timeline to market entry.
