# Project Brief: Block Puzzle Pro

**Session Date:** September 11, 2025
**Created by:** Business Analyst Mary ðŸ“Š
**Status:** âœ… APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT

## Executive Summary

**Block Puzzle Pro** is a colorful, strategic block puzzle game for iOS that revitalizes the classic line-clearing genre through player choice and research-backed engagement mechanics. The game solves the common retention problem in puzzle games by offering customizable session lengths (3/5/7 minutes), progressive block complexity, and non-intrusive monetization through rewarded video ads. Targeting casual mobile gamers who want quick, satisfying gameplay sessions, the game differentiates itself through learn-by-playing tutorials, score-based progression unlocks, and strategically-timed challenge blocks. With a proven Swift + SpriteKit technical foundation and AdMob integration, the MVP targets 40% Day 1 retention and sustainable revenue through player-controlled ad experiences.

## Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**
Mobile puzzle games suffer from a fundamental retention crisis. Industry data shows average Day 28 retention rates of just 1.5-3% for poorly designed puzzle games, with the primary cause being player boredom from repetitive mechanics. Our Five Whys analysis revealed that players abandon block puzzle games because the core mechanic doesn't evolve - most games increase difficulty only through speed rather than meaningful variety, leading to predictable gameplay patterns that players master and then abandon.

**Impact of the Problem:**
The puzzle game market represents a $3+ billion opportunity, but most developers fail to capture long-term value due to poor retention. Research shows getting bored is the #1 reason players stop playing puzzle games, with repetitive mechanics being the close second. This creates a missed opportunity where games could achieve 71% revenue increases through personalized progression (per our research data) but instead plateau at low engagement levels.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current block puzzle games prioritize short-term monetization over engagement depth, mistakenly believing that complexity hurts casual appeal. They conflate "complicated controls" with "evolving challenge," resulting in games that feel static after the initial learning phase. Most games also interrupt player flow with forced ads rather than offering player-controlled monetization options.

**Urgency & Importance:**
With mobile gaming becoming increasingly competitive and user acquisition costs rising, games that fail to retain players beyond Day 7 become economically unsustainable. The window to establish engagement patterns is narrow - research shows the first 30 seconds and first game over experience are make-or-break moments for retention.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept & Approach:**
Block Puzzle Pro implements a "Progressive Engagement Architecture" that evolves complexity through meaningful variety rather than artificial difficulty. The game starts with 3 familiar block types (L-shape, 1x1, 1x2) and gradually introduces new shapes based on player achievement milestones, culminating in strategic challenge blocks that appear occasionally at higher skill levels. Player agency is central - users choose their session length (3/5/7 minutes) and control monetization interactions through optional rewarded video ads.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Research-Backed Session Customization**: Unlike fixed-timer games, players select optimal session lengths based on industry data (3-7 minutes for top-performing puzzle games)
2. **Learn-by-Playing Onboarding**: Achieves 40% better retention than slideshow tutorials through immediate, guided interaction
3. **Score-Based Evolution**: New block shapes unlock at achievement milestones (every 500-2500 points), maintaining novelty without overwhelming casual players
4. **Player-Controlled Monetization**: Rewarded ads offer value (continue gameplay, power-ups) rather than interrupting flow, generating $9-17 eCPM

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
Our approach directly addresses the root causes identified in our Five Whys analysis. By introducing block variety gradually and giving players control over their experience, we solve the "repetitive mechanics" problem while maintaining casual accessibility. The technical foundation (Swift + SpriteKit) is proven, cost-effective, and allows rapid iteration based on player feedback.

**High-Level Product Vision:**
A puzzle game that grows with the player - simple enough for immediate satisfaction, deep enough for long-term engagement, and respectful enough of player time to build genuine loyalty rather than addiction-based retention.
