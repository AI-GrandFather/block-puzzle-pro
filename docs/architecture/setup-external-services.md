    static let rewardedAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1712485313"
    #else  
    static let appID = "YOUR_PRODUCTION_APP_ID"
    static let rewardedAdUnitID = "YOUR_PRODUCTION_REWARDED_UNIT_ID"
    #endif
}
```

### Production Phase
- Store production keys in Xcode build configurations
- Never commit production keys to git repository
- Use Xcode Cloud environment variables for CI/CD
