# Block Puzzle Pro Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Achieve 40%+ Day 1 retention through interactive learn-by-playing tutorial system
- Generate $10,000+ monthly revenue within 6 months via AdMob rewarded video integration
- Deliver satisfying 5-minute play sessions with customizable timer modes (3/5/7 minutes)
- Maintain 15%+ Day 7 retention through progressive block complexity unlocks
- Establish top 50 ranking in iOS Puzzle Games category within 12 months
- Create player-controlled monetization that respects user time and choice

### Background Context

Block Puzzle Pro addresses a critical retention crisis in mobile puzzle games, where industry averages show devastating 1.5-3% Day 28 retention rates primarily due to repetitive mechanics that fail to evolve. Research reveals players abandon block puzzle games because difficulty increases only through speed rather than meaningful variety, creating predictable gameplay patterns that lose appeal after mastery.

Our solution implements a "Progressive Engagement Architecture" targeting casual mobile gamers (25-45 years old) who desire quick mental stimulation during breaks but need flexible session lengths. By introducing new block shapes at score-based milestones (every 500-2500 points) rather than artificial speed increases, the game maintains novelty while respecting casual accessibility. The technical foundation leverages Swift 6.1 + SpriteKit with iOS 18.6.2 optimization, supporting a rapid 6-8 week development timeline to market entry.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Block Puzzle Pro delivers an immediately intuitive puzzle experience that feels both familiar and fresh. The interface prioritizes clarity and responsiveness over visual complexity, with colorful geometric blocks that pop against a clean background. Every interaction should feel satisfying through subtle haptic feedback and smooth animations that celebrate player achievements. The design philosophy centers on "invisible complexity" - sophisticated progression systems work behind the scenes while maintaining the visual simplicity that made classic block puzzles appealing.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop mechanics feel natural and precise, with visual feedback showing valid placement zones
- **Progressive Disclosure**: UI elements appear contextually (timer options unlock at 1000 points) rather than overwhelming new players
- **Celebration-Driven Feedback**: Line clears, score milestones, and new unlocks trigger satisfying visual and haptic responses
- **Player-Controlled Flow**: No interruptions or forced tutorials - players discover features organically through gameplay

### Core Screens and Views
- **Game Board Screen**: Primary 10x10 grid with persistent bottom block tray and score display
- **Tutorial Overlay**: Contextual guidance system that appears during first play without blocking interaction
- **Timer Selection Modal**: Clean interface for choosing 3/5/7 minute modes when unlocked
- **Game Over Screen**: Score summary with optional "Continue with Ad" and restart options
- **Block Unlock Celebration**: Brief animated notification when new shapes become available

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The game will implement WCAG AA compliance including high contrast color options for blocks, VoiceOver support for navigation elements, and haptic alternatives to audio feedback. Block shapes will be distinguishable through pattern/texture in addition to color to support colorblind players.

### Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with vibrant block colors (blues, greens, oranges, purples) against neutral backgrounds. Visual style emphasizes geometric precision and satisfying fits, drawing inspiration from successful puzzle games while maintaining unique personality. Typography will be clean and readable across all device sizes.

### Target Device and Platforms: Portrait-Only iOS
Portrait-only iOS design supporting iPhone SE through iPad Pro with fixed vertical orientation. Interface optimized for comfortable one-handed gameplay typical of mobile puzzle experiences.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single iOS project repository using Swift Package Manager for dependency management, containing all game assets, code, and configuration files. This approach simplifies version control and deployment for the solo development timeline.

### Service Architecture
**Monolith with Actor-based Components**: Single iOS app with Swift 6.1 async/await architecture using separate actors for GameEngine, ScoreTracker, BlockFactory, and AdManager. This provides clean separation of concerns while maintaining simple deployment and debugging.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration**: Core game logic unit tests for block placement, line clearing, and scoring algorithms. Integration tests for AdMob functionality and SwiftData persistence. Manual testing for touch interactions and visual feedback on multiple device sizes.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Platform Foundation:**
- Swift 6.1 with enhanced concurrency safety and improved compile times
- SpriteKit for 60fps game rendering and smooth animations

**Monetization Integration:**
- Google AdMob SDK (2025 version) for rewarded video ads
- Target $9-17 eCPM with 85%+ completion rates
- Player-controlled ad timing (continue gameplay, optional power-ups)

**Performance Targets:**
- <2 second app launch leveraging iOS 18.6.2 optimizations
- 120fps on ProMotion displays, 60fps minimum on all devices
- <80MB download size through App Thinning

**Development Constraints:**
- Solo development approach requiring self-sufficient technology choices
- 6-8 week timeline necessitating rapid iteration capabilities
- Portrait-only orientation for consistent mobile puzzle experience

**Data Persistence & Schema Evolution Strategy:**
- SwiftData VersionedSchema implementation with SchemaMigrationPlan for controlled schema evolution
- Lightweight migration support for: adding entities/attributes, renaming properties, changing relationship types
- Complex migration handling for data model restructuring with custom migration logic and data integrity validation
- Local backup export generating JSON snapshots with schema version metadata for cross-device restoration
- CloudKit integration with conflict resolution prioritizing device-local changes and user confirmation for significant conflicts
