- Direct manipulation with visual feedback for valid placement zones [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#key-interaction-paradigms]

**Technical Specifications:**
- Technology Stack: SwiftUI + SpriteKit integration [Source: architecture/components.md#gameview-component]
- Performance requirement: Maintain 60fps rendering [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- Platform: iOS 17+ with portrait orientation lock [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### File Locations
- Grid Engine: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/GameEngine.swift`
- Grid View: `BlockPuzzlePro/Views/GameView.swift`
- Grid Scene: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/GameScene.swift`
- Visual Constants: `BlockPuzzlePro/Design/VisualConstants.swift`

### Grid Implementation Details
**Grid Data Structure:**
```swift
// 10x10 grid with cell state tracking
var gameGrid: [[GridCell]] = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: GridCell.empty, count: 10), count: 10)

enum GridCell {
    case empty
    case occupied(color: BlockColor)
    case preview(color: BlockColor)
}
```

**Layout Specifications:**
- Total screen divided: Score area (15%) + Grid area (70%) + Block tray (15%)
- Grid margins: Minimum 20pt on sides for comfortable touch
- Cell size: Dynamic based on available space, minimum 30pt for accessibility
- Grid lines: 1pt width with 0.3 opacity for subtlety

**Visual Design Constants:**
- Background: Neutral gray/white as per branding guidelines
- Grid lines: Subtle gray (#E0E0E0) with low opacity
- Preview highlight: Semi-transparent block color overlay
- Valid placement zones: Subtle green tint (#E8F5E8) overlay
- Invalid zones: No special highlighting (maintain clean aesthetic)

### Performance Considerations
- Use SpriteKit node pooling for grid cells to maintain 60fps
- Implement efficient redraw system (only update changed cells)
- Pre-calculate grid positions during layout phase
- Optimize touch hit detection for responsive interaction

### Accessibility Requirements
- Grid cells must be discoverable by VoiceOver [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#accessibility]
- High contrast mode support for grid lines
- Minimum touch target size of 44pt (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)
- Visual feedback must be distinguishable through pattern in addition to color

### Testing Requirements
- Test on iPhone SE (smallest screen) through iPad Pro (largest screen)
- Verify grid scaling maintains proper proportions
- Confirm touch targets are accessible across all device sizes
- Validate 60fps performance during grid rendering
- Test visual feedback responsiveness
