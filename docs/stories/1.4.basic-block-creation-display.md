# Story 1.4: Basic Block Creation and Display

## Status
Done

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the BlockFactory component and integrates with the GameView for block display.

**Component Integration:**
- BlockFactory Component: Generate and manage available block types [Source: architecture/components.md#blockfactory-component]
- GameView Component: SwiftUI interface for block display [Source: architecture/components.md#gameview-component]
- Swift 6.1 Actor with in-memory caching [Source: architecture/components.md#technology-stack]

**Visual Design Requirements:**
- Vibrant block colors (blues, greens, oranges, purples) against neutral backgrounds [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]
- Clean geometric design with satisfying visual fit [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]
- Bottom tray as part of core game board screen [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#core-screens-and-views]

**Block Type Specifications:**
- Starting blocks: L-shape, 1x1, 1x2 as defined in requirements [Source: prd/requirements.md#functional-requirements]
- Infinite supply system for continuous gameplay [Source: prd/epic-1-foundation-core-gameplay-infrastructure.md#acceptance-criteria]

### File Locations
- Block Factory: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/BlockFactory.swift`
- Block Types: `BlockPuzzlePro/Models/BlockType.swift`
- Block View: `BlockPuzzlePro/Views/BlockView.swift`
- Tray View: `BlockPuzzlePro/Views/BlockTrayView.swift`
- Color System: `BlockPuzzlePro/Design/ColorSystem.swift`

### Block Implementation Details
**Block Type Definitions:**
```swift
enum BlockType: CaseIterable {
    case single     // 1x1
    case horizontal // 1x2
    case lShape     // L-shape
}

struct BlockPattern {
    let cells: [[Bool]]
    let color: BlockColor
    let size: CGSize
}
```

**Color Palette:**
- L-Shape: Orange (#FF6B35) - Most complex, warm attention color
- 1x1: Blue (#4A90E2) - Simple, cool and reliable
- 1x2: Green (#7ED321) - Medium complexity, fresh growth color
- Colors chosen for maximum distinguishability and visual appeal

**Bottom Tray Layout:**
- Tray height: 15% of screen height (consistent with layout spec)
- Three equally spaced slots with 20pt minimum spacing
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44pt (iOS accessibility guidelines)
- Background: Slightly darker than main background for definition

### BlockFactory Integration
```swift
actor BlockFactory {
    func generateNextBlocks() -> [BlockType] {
        // Return array of three starting block types
        return [.lShape, .single, .horizontal]
    }
    
    func getAvailableBlocks() -> [BlockType] {
        // For this story, always return the three starting types
        return [.lShape, .single, .horizontal]
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use SpriteKit node pooling for block rendering
- Cache block patterns to avoid recreation
- Implement efficient color application system
- Ensure 60fps during block regeneration animations

### Accessibility Requirements
- Block colors must work with high contrast mode
- Pattern/texture alternatives for colorblind users [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#accessibility]
- VoiceOver descriptions for each block type
- Touch targets meet iOS accessibility guidelines (44pt minimum)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with comprehensive test coverage. The architecture demonstrates proper separation of concerns with BlockType (model), BlockFactory (business logic), and BlockTrayView (presentation layers). The code follows Swift 6.1 standards with proper Actor pattern usage for thread safety and clean SwiftUI MVVM architecture.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The implementation is already well-structured and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to Swift naming conventions, MARK comments, and documentation standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized in Core/Models and Views directories per source-tree.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit test suite with 95+ test coverage of public APIs
