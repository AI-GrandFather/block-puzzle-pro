# Story 1.6: Line and Column Clearing Mechanics

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** complete rows and columns to clear automatically,
**so that** I can make space for more blocks and feel progression.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete horizontal rows (10 blocks) automatically clear with celebration animation
2. Complete vertical columns (10 blocks) automatically clear with celebration animation
3. Multiple simultaneous line/column clears are handled properly
4. Clearing animation provides satisfying visual feedback (brief highlight/fade)
5. Cleared spaces become immediately available for new block placement
6. No partial clears - only complete lines/columns trigger clearing

## Dev Notes

### Development Context
**Development Environment**: iOS 26 (September 2025) with iOS 17.0 minimum deployment target
**Date**: September 21, 2025

### Architecture Context
Implements core line-clearing mechanics through the GameEngine component with celebration-driven feedback.

**Component Integration:**
- GameEngine: Line clearing mechanics and grid management [Source: architecture/components.md#gameengine-component]
- GameView: Celebration animation rendering [Source: architecture/components.md#gameview-component]
- Celebration-driven feedback paradigm [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#key-interaction-paradigms]

### File Locations
- Clear Engine: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/ClearEngine.swift`
- Animation System: `BlockPuzzlePro/Animation/ClearAnimator.swift`
- Grid Manager: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/GridManager.swift`

### Line Detection Algorithm
```swift
func checkForCompletedLines() -> [LineType] {
    var completedLines: [LineType] = []
    
    // Check rows
    for row in 0..<10 {
        if isRowComplete(row) {
            completedLines.append(.horizontal(row))
        }
    }
    
    // Check columns  
    for col in 0..<10 {
        if isColumnComplete(col) {
            completedLines.append(.vertical(col))
        }
    }
    
    return completedLines
}
```

### Animation Specifications
- Line highlight: 0.2s bright flash before clearing
- Fade out: 0.3s smooth fade to transparent
- Particle effects: Brief confetti burst for celebration
- Multiple clears: Stagger timing by 0.1s for visual impact

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-21 (iOS 26 Development Context)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL REVIEW OVERSIGHT DISCOVERED** (iOS 26 Development Context): Core line clearing mechanics are functionally implemented with solid algorithm design in GameEngine.swift optimized for iOS 26 with iOS 17+ minimum requirements. However, this review initially **failed to identify that the prerequisite drag-and-drop system (Story 1.5) was fundamentally broken**, making line clearing untestable in practice.

Post-review analysis revealed:
- Drag-and-drop had gesture lifecycle violations causing UI freezes
- Coordinate space misalignment prevented stable block placement
- These issues made Story 1.6 functionally unusable despite correct line clearing logic

The implementation correctly handles simultaneous row/column detection and clearing with proper state management when blocks can be successfully placed. However, there are significant gaps between documented architecture and actual implementation, plus incomplete visual polish features.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review - focused on assessment and recommendations.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Swift conventions and project patterns
- Project Structure: ✗ Story references non-existent files (ClearEngine.swift, ClearAnimator.swift, GridManager.swift)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Inadequate test coverage for critical scenarios
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ Partially - core logic works but visual feedback incomplete

### Improvements Checklist

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY ISSUES:**
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Validate Story 1.5 drag-and-drop system is working before testing line clearing
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Verify end-to-end flow: drag block → place on grid → trigger line clear
- [ ] Add integration tests that validate prerequisite functionality

**Critical Test Coverage Gaps:**
- [ ] Add column clearing tests (AC2 validation)
- [ ] Add simultaneous row+column clear tests (AC3 validation)
- [ ] Add animation integration tests (AC4 validation)
- [ ] Add immediate availability tests after clearing (AC5 validation)
- [ ] Add edge case tests (L-shaped intersections, boundary conditions)

**Animation System Enhancements:**
- [ ] Implement staggered timing for multiple clears (0.1s specified)
- [ ] Add particle effects system (currently deferred)
- [ ] Create dedicated ClearAnimator as documented
- [ ] Performance test animation at 60fps requirement

**Documentation & Architecture:**
- [ ] Update story file locations to match actual implementation
- [ ] Document actual vs planned architecture differences
- [ ] Remove TODO comments in GameScene.swift
- [ ] Consider performance optimization for O(n²) scanning

### Security Review

No security concerns identified - game logic operates on local state only.

### Performance Considerations

- Minor concern: O(n²) grid scanning could be optimized with dirty flagging for large numbers of placements
- Animation performance appears well-managed with proper frame timing
- Memory allocation patterns are reasonable for game scope

### Files Modified During Review

None - assessment only.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.6-line-column-clearing-mechanics.yml

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

**Key Blockers**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Story 1.5 drag-and-drop system was fundamentally broken during this story's implementation, making line clearing untestable
2. Insufficient test coverage for production confidence, particularly missing tests for core AC scenarios (column clearing, simultaneous clears)
3. Animation system lacks specified polish features though basic functionality works

**QA Process Improvement**: This review failed to validate prerequisite dependencies, leading to approval of untestable functionality. Future reviews must validate end-to-end user flows before approving dependent stories.
