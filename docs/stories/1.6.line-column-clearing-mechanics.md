# Story 1.6: Line and Column Clearing Mechanics

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** complete rows and columns to clear automatically,
**so that** I can make space for more blocks and feel progression.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete horizontal rows (10 blocks) automatically clear with celebration animation
2. Complete vertical columns (10 blocks) automatically clear with celebration animation
3. Multiple simultaneous line/column clears are handled properly
4. Clearing animation provides satisfying visual feedback (brief highlight/fade)
5. Cleared spaces become immediately available for new block placement
6. No partial clears - only complete lines/columns trigger clearing

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Line Detection Algorithm (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [x] Implement horizontal row completion detection
  - [x] Implement vertical column completion detection
  - [x] Create efficient scanning algorithm for grid state
  - [x] Ensure detection only triggers on complete lines (10 cells)
  - [x] Test detection accuracy across various grid configurations
- [x] Task 2: Multiple Clear Handling (AC: 3)
  - [x] Detect simultaneous row and column clears
  - [x] Handle multiple rows clearing at once
  - [x] Handle multiple columns clearing at once
  - [x] Coordinate clearing order for visual consistency
  - [x] Ensure proper state management during multiple clears
- [x] Task 3: Clearing Animation System (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create satisfying highlight animation for clearing lines
  - [x] Implement fade-out effect for cleared blocks
  - [ ] Add celebration particle effects for line clears *(deferred)*
  - [x] Ensure animations don't block gameplay flow
  - [x] Test animation performance at 60fps
- [x] Task 4: Grid State Updates (AC: 5)
  - [x] Clear completed lines from grid data structure
  - [x] Update visual grid representation immediately
  - [x] Ensure cleared spaces are marked as available
  - [x] Validate grid state consistency after clearing
  - [x] Handle edge cases with simultaneous clears

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Implements core line-clearing mechanics through the GameEngine component with celebration-driven feedback.

**Component Integration:**
- GameEngine: Line clearing mechanics and grid management [Source: architecture/components.md#gameengine-component]
- GameView: Celebration animation rendering [Source: architecture/components.md#gameview-component]
- Celebration-driven feedback paradigm [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#key-interaction-paradigms]

### File Locations
- Clear Engine: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/ClearEngine.swift`
- Animation System: `BlockPuzzlePro/Animation/ClearAnimator.swift`
- Grid Manager: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/GridManager.swift`

### Line Detection Algorithm
```swift
func checkForCompletedLines() -> [LineType] {
    var completedLines: [LineType] = []
    
    // Check rows
    for row in 0..<10 {
        if isRowComplete(row) {
            completedLines.append(.horizontal(row))
        }
    }
    
    // Check columns  
    for col in 0..<10 {
        if isColumnComplete(col) {
            completedLines.append(.vertical(col))
        }
    }
    
    return completedLines
}
```

### Animation Specifications
- Line highlight: 0.2s bright flash before clearing
- Fade out: 0.3s smooth fade to transparent
- Particle effects: Brief confetti burst for celebration
- Multiple clears: Stagger timing by 0.1s for visual impact

## Dev Agent Record
| Date | Agent | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2025-09-20 | Dev Agent (ChatGPT) | Added line-clear summary APIs in `GameEngine`, SwiftUI highlight overlay, and story documentation updates. Particle effects deferred for later polish. |
