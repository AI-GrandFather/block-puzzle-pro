## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story integrates AdMob for rewarded video ads as a core monetization strategy, following the external API specifications.

**AdMob Integration Pattern:**
- Purpose: Rewarded video ads for continue gameplay and power-ups [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#admob-api]
- SDK handles all network calls internally [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#integration-notes]
- Authentication via AdMob App ID and Ad Unit IDs [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#authentication]
- Standard AdMob quotas with unlimited usage for most cases [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#rate-limits]

**External Service Setup:**
- Requires Google account and Apple Developer Program enrollment [Source: architecture/setup-external-services.md#prerequisites]
- Test Rewarded Video Unit: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1712485313` [Source: architecture/setup-external-services.md#configure-test-devices]
- iOS 18.6.2 requires ATT prompt before ad personalization [Source: architecture/setup-external-services.md#app-tracking-transparency-setup]

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must not block 60fps gameplay performance [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- Background loading to maintain user experience [Source: prd/epic-1-foundation-core-gameplay-infrastructure.md#acceptance-criteria]
- Player-controlled monetization (never forced ads) [Source: architecture/introduction.md#player-controlled-monetization]

### File Locations
- AdMob configuration: `BlockPuzzlePro/AdMobConfig.swift`
- Ad Manager: `BlockPuzzlePro/AdManager.swift`
- Info.plist: Add AdMob App ID and ATT usage description
- Build configurations: Set up dev/production ad unit switching

### AdMob Configuration Details
```swift
// Development Configuration
static let testAppID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511"
static let testRewardedAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1712485313"

// Production Configuration (to be configured later)
static let productionAppID = "YOUR_PRODUCTION_APP_ID"
static let productionRewardedAdUnitID = "YOUR_PRODUCTION_REWARDED_UNIT_ID"
```

**Required Info.plist Additions:**
- `GADApplicationIdentifier`: AdMob App ID
- `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`: ATT permission description
- Network security configurations if needed

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Initialize AdMob SDK in AppDelegate/App struct during launch
- Use async/await pattern for ad loading to prevent blocking
- Implement proper error handling for all ad operations
- Follow Apple's ATT guidelines for permission requests
- Ensure compliance with both Apple and Google advertising policies

### Testing Requirements
- Test on both iPhone and iPad simulators
- Verify ad loading works with test units
- Test network failure scenarios
- Validate ATT permission flow
- Confirm no impact on game performance during ad operations

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 13, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: HIGH QUALITY IMPLEMENTATION**
The AdMob integration demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with proper architecture separation, comprehensive error handling, and well-structured async/await patterns. The implementation follows Apple's recommended patterns for ad integration and properly handles App Tracking Transparency requirements.

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated managers for AdMob, ATT, and game integration
- Proper use of Swift actors for thread-safety in AdManager
- Comprehensive logging using os.log framework
- Configuration-based approach allowing dev/production switching
- Background ad loading to maintain 60fps performance requirement

### Refactoring Performed

**GameAdIntegration.swift:30-35**
- **Change**: Fixed delegate assignment to use direct property assignment instead of non-existent async method
- **Why**: The AdManager.shared.setRewardDelegate method doesn't exist - should use direct property assignment
- **How**: Changed `await AdManager.shared.setRewardDelegate(self)` to `AdManager.shared.rewardDelegate = self`

**ATTManager.swift:99-104**  
- **Change**: Added missing notification posting when ATT status changes
- **Why**: The notifyStatusChanged() method was defined but never called, breaking the notification system
- **How**: Added `notifyStatusChanged()` call after status update to properly notify observers

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Follows all Swift coding standards with proper MARK comments, clear naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ **COMPLIANT** - Files properly organized in Core/Services directory per architecture requirements  
- Testing Strategy: ❌ **MAJOR GAP** - No unit tests implemented for critical ad functionality
- All ACs Met: ✓ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All 6 acceptance criteria have corresponding implementations
