# Story 1.9: Block Placement Scoring Refinement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to earn points based on block size and placement difficulty,
**so that** strategic placement feels rewarded beyond just line clearing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Different block types award points based on complexity (1x1 = 1pt, L-shape = 3pts, etc.)
2. Placement in constrained spaces provides small bonus multiplier
3. Consecutive placements without clearing provide incremental bonus
4. Scoring feedback appears briefly at placement location
5. Total session points continuously update in real-time
6. Point values feel balanced - placement valuable but clearing more rewarding
