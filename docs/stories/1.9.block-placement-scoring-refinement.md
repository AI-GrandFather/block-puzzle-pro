# Story 1.9: Block Placement Scoring Refinement

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to earn points based on block size and placement difficulty,
**so that** strategic placement feels rewarded beyond just line clearing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Different block types award points based on complexity (1x1 = 1pt, L-shape = 3pts, etc.)
2. Placement in constrained spaces provides small bonus multiplier
3. Consecutive placements without clearing provide incremental bonus
4. Scoring feedback appears briefly at placement location
5. Total session points continuously update in real-time
6. Point values feel balanced - placement valuable but clearing more rewarding

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Block Type Scoring (AC: 1)
- [x] Task 2: Difficulty Multipliers (AC: 2, 3)
- [x] Task 3: Visual Feedback (AC: 4, 5)
- [x] Task 4: Balance Testing (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
Refines the scoring system with strategic depth and visual feedback.

- `ScoreTracker` awards per-cell placement values along with combo streak multipliers for consecutive drops without clears.
- `ScoreEvent` surfaces placement vs. combo breakdown, allowing `ScoreView` and celebration overlays to present the earned delta inline with the board.
- In-grid combo glow and toast overlays ensure players see placement rewards immediately while the tray recycles.
