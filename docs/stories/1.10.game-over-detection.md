# Story 1.10: Game Over Detection

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** the game to detect when no more moves are possible,
**so that** I know when my current session has ended.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Game automatically detects when no available blocks can fit on remaining grid space
2. Game over detection accounts for all three block types in bottom tray
3. Game over state displays final score clearly
4. Game over detection is accurate and doesn't trigger false positives
5. Game over state provides clear visual indication of session end

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Move Validation Algorithm (AC: 1, 2, 4)
- [ ] Task 2: Game Over UI (AC: 3, 5)
