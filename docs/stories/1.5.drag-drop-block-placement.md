## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements core drag-and-drop interaction using SwiftUI gestures and SpriteKit integration.

**Component Integration:**
- GameEngine Component: Block placement validation and grid state management [Source: architecture/components.md#gameengine-component]
- GameView Component: Touch gesture recognition and SwiftUI interface [Source: architecture/components.md#gameview-component]
- Direct manipulation interaction paradigm [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#key-interaction-paradigms]

**Performance Requirements:**
- Maintain 60fps during drag operations [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- Smooth touch response for natural feel [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#overall-ux-vision]
- Responsive interaction without blocking [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#key-interaction-paradigms]

### File Locations
- Drag Controller: `BlockPuzzlePro/Input/DragController.swift`
- Placement Logic: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/PlacementEngine.swift`
- Gesture Views: `BlockPuzzlePro/Views/DraggableBlockView.swift`
- Animation System: `BlockPuzzlePro/Animation/PlacementAnimator.swift`

### Drag Implementation Details
**Gesture Handling:**
```swift
@GestureState private var dragOffset = CGSize.zero
@State private var isDragging = false

var dragGesture: some Gesture {
    DragGesture(coordinateSpace: .global)
        .updating($dragOffset) { value, state, _ in
            state = value.translation
            isDragging = true
        }
        .onEnded { value in
            handleDrop(at: value.location)
        }
}
```

**Placement Validation:**
- Check grid boundaries (0-9 x 0-9)
- Verify no collision with existing blocks
- Validate complete block pattern fits
- Return validation result with feedback type

**Visual Feedback System:**
- Valid placement: Subtle green overlay on target cells
- Invalid placement: No special highlighting (clean aesthetic)
- Drag preview: Semi-transparent block at current position
- Placement animation: Smooth snap with brief highlight

### GameEngine Integration
```swift
// In GameEngine Actor
func placeBlock(blockType: BlockType, position: GridPosition) -> PlacementResult {
    // Validate placement
    guard isValidPlacement(blockType, at: position) else {
        return .invalid
    }
    
    // Update grid state
    applyBlockToGrid(blockType, at: position)
    
    return .success
}
```

### Animation Specifications
- Drag lift: 0.15s ease-out with scale(1.1) and shadow
- Drop snap: 0.25s spring animation to grid position
- Invalid return: 0.3s ease-in-out back to tray
- Placement complete: 0.1s brief highlight flash

### Performance Considerations
- Use efficient hit testing for grid position detection
- Implement touch prediction for smooth following
- Optimize redraw regions during drag operations
- Cache placement validation results when possible

### Accessibility Requirements
- VoiceOver support for drag operations
- Alternative placement method for users with motor difficulties
- Clear audio feedback for placement success/failure
- Haptic feedback for placement confirmation

## Change Log
| Date       | Version | Description                             | Author   |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 2025-01-15 | 1.0     | Initial story creation                  | Bob (SM) |
| 2025-01-18 | 1.1     | Drag preview and placement engine tune  | AthenaAI |

### 2025-01-18 Stabilization Notes
- Replaced the temporary placement helper with the dedicated `PlacementEngine` so drag previews use grid-aligned math and collision checks.
- Snapping now mirrors the grid origin by reading the engine preview and offsetting the floating overlay, eliminating the first-move stall.
- Drag controller throttling now keys off the device refresh interval (120 Hz on ProMotion) and publishes final positions before `endDrag`, avoiding "stuck" blocks.
- Updated `GameEngine` and `BlockFactory` mutations to trigger published changes immediately, preventing stale tray/grid state.
- Cleared compiler warnings and documented the stabilization for future reference.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DISCONNECT IDENTIFIED**

The drag-and-drop implementation is **technically complete and well-architected** but suffers from a critical integration failure that renders all functionality inaccessible to users.

#### Implementation Quality: ✅ EXCELLENT
- **DragController.swift**: Sophisticated gesture handling with 60fps optimization and device-specific tuning
- **PlacementEngine.swift**: Comprehensive placement validation with collision detection
- **DragDropGameView.swift**: Complete UI integration with proper state management
- **PlacementAnimator.swift**: Device-optimized animations with accessibility support

#### Architecture Quality: ✅ SOLID
- MVVM pattern correctly implemented
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper dependency injection
- Performance optimizations present

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - the implementation quality is production-ready. The issue is purely integration-related.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to Swift/SwiftUI best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper component organization and separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit test coverage provided
- All ACs Met: ✗ **CRITICAL: Zero ACs met due to integration failure**

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 🔴 **BLOCKING: View Integration Failure** 
**Root Cause:** App loads `GameView.swift` (basic tap-based) instead of `DragDropGameView.swift` (full drag system)
- **Location:** `BlockPuzzleProApp.swift:68` - `ContentView()` → `GameView()`
- **Impact:** Complete drag functionality invisible to users
- **Severity:** HIGH - Total feature failure

#### 🔴 **BLOCKING: SIGTERM Crash**
**Root Cause:** Memory management issues causing app termination
- **Symptoms:** mach_msg2_trap, Thread 1 signal SIGTERM
- **Location:** Low-level system calls in concurrent gesture handling
- **Impact:** App instability and crashes during interaction

#### 🟡 **Missing Components**
- Missing view components referenced in DragDropGameView
- Incomplete error handling for view integration failures

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** - No security vulnerabilities identified
- Proper input validation in placement engine
- No sensitive data exposure in drag operations
- Safe memory management patterns used

### Performance Considerations

✅ **EXCELLENT** - Performance optimizations present but not activated
- 60fps throttling implemented in DragController
- Device-specific optimizations in DeviceManager
- Memory-efficient gesture state management

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - Integration fix required by development team

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.5-drag-drop-block-placement.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/1.5-risk-20250917.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/1.5-nfr-20250917.md

### Immediate Remediation Required

#### 🚨 **CRITICAL PATH TO SUCCESS:**

1. **Replace GameView with DragDropGameView** (5 minutes)
   ```swift
   // In BlockPuzzleProApp.swift line 68:
   // CHANGE: GameView()
   // TO: DragDropGameView()
   ```

2. **Add Missing View Dependencies** (15 minutes)
   - Create `GridContainerView.swift`
   - Create `DraggableBlockTrayView.swift` 
   - Create `FloatingBlockPreview.swift`

3. **Fix Memory Management** (30 minutes)
   - Add proper cleanup in DragController deinit
   - Fix timer disposal in gesture handling
   - Add memory pressure monitoring

#### 📋 **Verification Steps:**
1. App builds without errors
2. Drag gestures respond to touch
3. Blocks follow finger movement
4. Valid placement highlights appear
5. Invalid drops return to tray
6. Successful placements commit to grid

### Recommended Status

❌ **Changes Required** - Critical integration fixes needed before Story 1.5 can be considered complete

**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours
**Risk Level:** HIGH (Total feature non-functionality)
**Business Impact:** Complete drag-and-drop feature unavailable to users

### Quality Score: 20/100
(Excellent implementation quality penalized by complete integration failure)
