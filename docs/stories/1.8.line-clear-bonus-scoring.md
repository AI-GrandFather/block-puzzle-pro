# Story 1.8: Line Clear Bonus Scoring

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to receive bonus points for clearing multiple lines simultaneously,
**so that** I'm rewarded for strategic planning and optimal block placement.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single line/column clear provides base bonus (e.g., 100 points)
2. Double simultaneous clears provide escalated bonus (e.g., 300 points total)
3. Triple simultaneous clears provide major bonus (e.g., 600 points total)
4. Scoring formula rewards simultaneous clears exponentially, not linearly
5. Combo scoring displays briefly during clearing animation
6. Score calculation is transparent and feels fair to players
