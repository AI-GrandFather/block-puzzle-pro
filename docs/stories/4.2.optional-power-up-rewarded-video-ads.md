# Story 4.2: Optional Power-up Rewarded Video Ads

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** the option to watch ads for helpful power-ups during gameplay,
**so that** I can get assistance when stuck while choosing when to engage with ads.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Subtle power-up button available during gameplay (not intrusive)
2. Power-up options include: clear random blocks, clear bottom row, or get hint for optimal placement
3. Rewarded video plays only when player initiates power-up request
4. Power-up delivery feels immediately helpful and worth the ad time investment
5. Frequency limiting prevents overuse - maximum 2 power-ups per game session
6. Power-up button disappears when not available (cooldown or limit reached)
