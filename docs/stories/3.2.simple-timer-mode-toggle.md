## Dev Notes

### MVP Simplification
Based on scope refinement, this implements a simple binary toggle instead of complex mode selection with multiple timer options.

**Simplified Approach:**
- Binary toggle: Endless vs. 5-Minute Challenge [Source: prd/mvp-scope-refinement.md#recommended-mvp]
- Unified scoring system with time bonus [Source: prd/mvp-scope-refinement.md#recommended-mvp]
- Simpler implementation for faster delivery [Source: prd/mvp-scope-refinement.md#recommended-mvp]
