## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundational iOS project structure using the native Apple development stack as defined in our architecture.

**Platform Foundation:**
- Native iOS project using Swift 6.1 and SpriteKit [Source: architecture/introduction.md#starter-template-or-existing-project]
- Actor-based monolith architecture pattern for component separation [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]
- Portrait-only orientation with offline-first design [Source: architecture/introduction.md#constraints]

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend Language: Swift 6.1 for native iOS performance [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Game Framework: SpriteKit for 60fps game rendering and animations [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]
- Build Tool: Xcode (latest) for iOS builds [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Logging: os_log (iOS 17+) for debug logs [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Performance Requirements:**
- 60fps performance requirement [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- <2 second launch times target [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- iOS 17+ minimum support for 95% device coverage [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]

**Project Structure Foundation:**
- Single iOS app with integrated services (CloudKit, AdMob) [Source: architecture/introduction.md#target]
- Designed for AI-driven development with clear patterns [Source: architecture/introduction.md#ai-driven-development]
- 6-8 week rapid development timeline [Source: architecture/introduction.md#development-timeline]

### File Locations
- Main project: `BlockPuzzlePro/` (Xcode project root)
- Game scene: `BlockPuzzlePro/GameScene.swift`
- App delegate: `BlockPuzzlePro/AppDelegate.swift` or use SwiftUI App structure
- Assets: `BlockPuzzlePro/Assets.xcassets`
- Info.plist: `BlockPuzzlePro/Info.plist`

### Technical Constraints
- Swift 6.1 for enhanced concurrency safety [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]
- Portrait orientation only [Source: architecture/introduction.md#constraints]
- iOS 17+ minimum deployment target [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Universal iPhone/iPad support required [Source: prd/epic-1-foundation-core-gameplay-infrastructure.md#acceptance-criteria]

### Testing
- Verify compilation on both iPhone and iPad simulators
- Test portrait orientation lock functionality
- Confirm basic app lifecycle events work correctly
- Validate SpriteKit scene initializes and displays
