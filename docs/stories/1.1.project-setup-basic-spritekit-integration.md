# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic SpriteKit Integration

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create the iOS project structure with SpriteKit framework,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for game development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Xcode project created with Swift 6.1 and iOS 17+ minimum deployment target
2. SpriteKit game scene configured with portrait orientation lock
3. Basic app lifecycle management implemented (launch, background, foreground)
4. Project compiles and runs successfully on both iPhone and iPad simulators
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for iOS development

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create Xcode Project (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create new iOS Game project in Xcode
  - [ ] Set project name to "BlockPuzzlePro"
  - [ ] Configure Swift 6.1 as language
  - [ ] Set iOS 17.0 as minimum deployment target
  - [ ] Select SpriteKit as game technology
  - [ ] Enable universal device support (iPhone/iPad)
- [ ] Task 2: Configure SpriteKit Game Scene (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Set up initial GameScene with portrait orientation lock
  - [ ] Configure scene size for portrait mode
  - [ ] Add basic scene lifecycle methods (didMove, update)
  - [ ] Test scene renders properly on different device sizes
- [ ] Task 3: Implement App Lifecycle Management (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure AppDelegate for proper lifecycle handling
  - [ ] Handle app launch, background, and foreground transitions
  - [ ] Add basic logging for lifecycle events using os_log
  - [ ] Ensure SpriteKit pauses/resumes appropriately
- [ ] Task 4: Project Compilation and Testing (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Verify project compiles without errors
  - [ ] Test on iPhone simulator (multiple sizes)
  - [ ] Test on iPad simulator
  - [ ] Confirm portrait orientation lock works correctly
- [ ] Task 5: Git Repository Setup (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Initialize git repository in project root
  - [ ] Create comprehensive iOS .gitignore file
  - [ ] Make initial commit with project setup

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundational iOS project structure using the native Apple development stack as defined in our architecture.

**Platform Foundation:**
- Native iOS project using Swift 6.1 and SpriteKit [Source: architecture/introduction.md#starter-template-or-existing-project]
- Actor-based monolith architecture pattern for component separation [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]
- Portrait-only orientation with offline-first design [Source: architecture/introduction.md#constraints]

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend Language: Swift 6.1 for native iOS performance [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Game Framework: SpriteKit for 60fps game rendering and animations [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]
- Build Tool: Xcode (latest) for iOS builds [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Logging: os_log (iOS 17+) for debug logs [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Performance Requirements:**
- 60fps performance requirement [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- <2 second launch times target [Source: architecture/introduction.md#performance-requirements]
- iOS 17+ minimum support for 95% device coverage [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]

**Project Structure Foundation:**
- Single iOS app with integrated services (CloudKit, AdMob) [Source: architecture/introduction.md#target]
- Designed for AI-driven development with clear patterns [Source: architecture/introduction.md#ai-driven-development]
- 6-8 week rapid development timeline [Source: architecture/introduction.md#development-timeline]

### File Locations
- Main project: `BlockPuzzlePro/` (Xcode project root)
- Game scene: `BlockPuzzlePro/GameScene.swift`
- App delegate: `BlockPuzzlePro/AppDelegate.swift` or use SwiftUI App structure
- Assets: `BlockPuzzlePro/Assets.xcassets`
- Info.plist: `BlockPuzzlePro/Info.plist`

### Technical Constraints
- Swift 6.1 for enhanced concurrency safety [Source: architecture/introduction.md#key-architectural-decisions]
- Portrait orientation only [Source: architecture/introduction.md#constraints]
- iOS 17+ minimum deployment target [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Universal iPhone/iPad support required [Source: prd/epic-1-foundation-core-gameplay-infrastructure.md#acceptance-criteria]

### Testing
- Verify compilation on both iPhone and iPad simulators
- Test portrait orientation lock functionality
- Confirm basic app lifecycle events work correctly
- Validate SpriteKit scene initializes and displays
