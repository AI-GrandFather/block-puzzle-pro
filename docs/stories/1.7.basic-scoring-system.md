# Story 1.7: Basic Scoring System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to see my score increase when I clear lines and place blocks,
**so that** I can track my progress and feel achievement.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Score display prominently positioned at top of screen
2. Points awarded for each block placed (base points per block)
3. Bonus points awarded for line/column clearing (higher value than placement)
4. Multiple simultaneous clears provide cumulative bonus scoring
5. Score persists throughout game session and updates in real-time
6. Score resets to zero when starting a new game

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Implements ScoreTracker component with real-time display integration.

**Component Integration:**
- ScoreTracker Component: Score calculation and tracking [Source: architecture/components.md#scoretracker-component]
- Swift 6.1 Actor for thread-safe score management [Source: architecture/components.md#technology-stack]

### File Locations
- Score Tracker: `BlockPuzzlePro/Game/ScoreTracker.swift`
- Score View: `BlockPuzzlePro/Views/ScoreView.swift`

### Scoring Algorithm
- Block placement: 1 point per cell (L-shape = 3pts, 1x1 = 1pt, 1x2 = 2pts)
- Single line clear: 100 bonus points
- Double clear: 300 total points (exponential bonus)
- Triple+ clear: 600+ total points
