## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,

**so that** I have even more strategic placement options and feel significant progression.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. T-shaped block unlocks automatically at exactly 1000 points milestone
2. Celebration animation for T-block unlock feels more significant than previous unlock
3. T-block appears in bottom tray with all previously unlocked blocks
